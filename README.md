# Pyber-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to help Omar perform an analysis on various ride-sharing data from 2019. Through the use of Pyber and MatplotLib, we were able to compare total rides, total drivers, and total fares by city type. In addition, we determined the average fares per ride and per driver. 


## Results

	Total Rides	Total Drivers	Total Fares	Average Fare per Ride	Average Fare per Driver
Rural	125	78	$4,327.93	$34.62	$55.49
Suburban	625	490	$19,356.33	$30.97	$39.50
Urban	1,625	2,405	$39,854.38	$24.53	$16.57
