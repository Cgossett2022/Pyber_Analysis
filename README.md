# Pyber-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to help Omar perform an analysis on various ride-share data for January - April of 2019. Through the use of Pyber and MatplotLib, we were able to compare Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares by city type. In addition, we determined the average fares per ride and per driver. 


## Results

The ride-share results can be summarized in the following table:

Based on the analysis, Total Rides, Total Fares, and Total Drivers were all higher for more urbanized areas. This makes sense, because more people are in the cities which means there is a higher demand for ride-share services than in rural areas. It is also worth highlighting that the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver was higher in rural areas, possibly due to drivers having to travel a farther distance to pick up riders.

## Summary

In conclusion, I have the following recommendations for the CEO at V. Isualize:

1.  Since the majority of rides occur in urban areas, the fares could be raised and this would provide an opportunity to make more money without losing business.
2.  Hiring more drivers to service rural areas could also boost revenues since the average fare per driver is significantly higher than in urban areas.
3.  Consider raising prices for suburban areas which could eliminate riders that don't really need a ride and allow drivers to choose between convenient (urban areas) or more profitable (rural areas) opportunities.
